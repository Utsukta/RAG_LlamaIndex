Implementation of RAG using LLamaIndex and Qdrant

Here, I have implemented the Retrieval Augmented Generation(RAG) using the "llama3" llm model and "snowflake-arctic-embed" embedding model through Ollama. 
For the UI, I have used streamlit.

User can send query and on the basis of the query provided, the RAG will provide the appropriate response to the user.
